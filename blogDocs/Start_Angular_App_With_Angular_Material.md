\nDownload and install the necessary tools to create a new Angular app.  \nPlease see [Angular Setup](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) for more in-depth details.  \nOnce you have the necessary tools an create a new angular app (keep in mind that these instruction are based on Angular 13)\n\n\n``` ng new blogapp --style=scss --strict=true ``` \n\nMove to the project directory\n\n`` cd blogapp ``\n\nMake sure the project runs\n\n``` npm start ```\n\nAssuming the project was successfully created then let's start adding [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started)\n\n``` ng add @angular/material ```\n\nFollow the interactive options. I choose to create a custom material theme however a prebuild theme will work as well. Here is the theme file I used.\n\n```\n@use "@angular/material" as mat;\n@include mat.core();\n\n$typography-theme: mat.define-typography-config(\n  $font-family: "Open Sans",\n);\n$portfolio-primary: mat.define-palette(mat.$indigo-palette);\n$portfolio-accent: mat.define-palette(mat.$pink-palette, A200, A100, A400);\n\n$portfolio-warn: mat.define-palette(mat.$red-palette);\n\n$portfolio-theme: mat.define-light-theme(\n  (\n    color: (\n      primary: $portfolio-primary,\n      accent: $portfolio-accent,\n      warn: $portfolio-warn,\n    ),\n  )\n);\n@include mat.core($typography-theme);\n@include mat.all-component-themes($portfolio-theme);\n\n```\nNow let's double check that the new material theme was adding to our angular.json file. There are two spots, make sure it is added in both locations.\n```\n"styles": ["src/styles.scss", "src/material-theme.scss"],\n```\nGreat! Now let's make sure everything is working as expected. Remove all content from app.component.html except for the router outlet and add a mat-button\n\n```\n<button mat-stroked-button color="primary>Test</button>\n<router-outlet></router-outlet>\n```\nDon't for get to [import the MatButtonModule](https://material.angular.io/components/button/api) in app.component.module!\n\nRun the program and you should see the material button as seen on the documentation with the correct theme color.\n\nAwesome! Now we should have the foundation necessary to start building an angular web application.\n
